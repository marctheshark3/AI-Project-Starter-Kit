# AI Project Starter Kit

A comprehensive toolkit for efficiently starting and managing AI projects using LLMs for documentation generation, GitHub for project management, and Cursor for AI-assisted development.

## üöÄ Overview

This toolkit streamlines the AI project development process by providing:

1. **LLM-Powered Documentation Generation** - Templates and prompts for generating comprehensive PRDs, architecture diagrams, and Docker configurations
2. **GitHub Project Management** - Step-by-step guide for setting up and managing GitHub repositories
3. **AI-Assisted Development** - Guide for using Cursor with the @ tool to reference documentation during implementation

## üìö Contents

### System Prompts for LLMs
- **`Comprehensive AI Project Initialization System Prompt`** - A unified prompt for generating PRDs, diagrams, and Docker configurations

### Guides
- **`Cursor Guide`** - How to use Cursor with the @ tool to reference your PRD during development
- **`GitHub Setup Guide`** - Step-by-step instructions for setting up GitHub repositories and project boards
- **`AI Project Starter Guide`** - Complete workflow from ideation to deployment

### Visual Resources
- **`AI Project Workflow Diagrams`** - Mermaid diagrams illustrating project components and workflows

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use This Toolkit

### Step 1: Generate Project Documentation

1. Copy the `Comprehensive AI Project Initialization System Prompt`
2. Replace the placeholder sections with your specific project details
3. Submit to your preferred LLM (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
4. Save the generated PRD, diagrams, and Docker configurations

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Repository

1. Follow the `GitHub Setup Guide` to create and configure your repository
2. Create a project board with appropriate columns
3. Set up issue templates and branch protection
4. Add your generated documentation to the repository

### Step 3: Develop with Cursor

1. Install Cursor following the instructions in the `Cursor Guide`
2. Import your project documentation
3. Use the @ tool to reference your PRD during development
4. Follow the examples in the guide for effective prompting

## üìã Workflow Overview

1. **Project Inception**
   - Define project goals and requirements
   - Use the system prompt to generate comprehensive documentation

2. **Project Setup**
   - Create GitHub repository with appropriate structure
   - Configure project board with automation
   - Create milestones based on project phases

3. **Development**
   - Use Cursor with @ tool to reference PRD
   - Implement features according to specifications
   - Create pull requests and track progress

4. **Deployment**
   - Use generated Docker configurations
   - Deploy development and production environments
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines

## üìä Project Management

The included guides and templates support:
- Task breakdown and organization
- Progress tracking through GitHub Projects
- Phase-based development with milestones
- Collaborative development with PR templates and review processes

## üß© Infrastructure Management

The system prompt generates:
- Development container specifications
- Production container with Nginx for custom DNS deployment
- Docker Compose configurations for local development
- Nginx configurations for production deployment

## üîÑ Extensibility

This toolkit is designed to be extensible:
- Update the system prompts for different project types
- Modify the GitHub templates for your team's workflow
- Customize the Docker configurations for different tech stacks
